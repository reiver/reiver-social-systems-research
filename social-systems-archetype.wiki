Â§ Social-Systems Archetype

â¸º by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

ðŸ ¶ archetypes (noun): an idealized model of a number of similar things.

From the point-of-view of [[social-systems-research]] â€” an **archetype** is a model of some aspect of a person shared among many people.

UX people tend to call "**archetypes**": "**personas**".
And marketers tend to call "**archetypes**": "**segments**".
In practice, all 3 of these are very similar concepts.

Some examples of **archetypes** include:

â€¢ father,
â€¢ mother,
â€¢ son,
â€¢ daughter
â€¢ brother,
â€¢ sister,
â€¢ husband,
â€¢ wife,
â€¢ gardener,
â€¢ farmer,
â€¢ computer programmer,
â€¢ grocery store cashier,
â€¢ CEO
â€¢ CTO
â€¢ etc.

You can also probably already see that an individual could express more than one **archetype**.
For example â€” a single individual could be â€” a //father//, a //husband//, a //brother//, a //son//, a //CTO//, and a //programmer// **at the same time** during a certain span of their life.

The **archetypes** an individual expresses could also change over their life-time too.
For example â€” before someone has a child, they wouldn't be a //father// or a //mother// yet; but after they have a child, they would (also) become a //father//, or a //mother// (in addition to whatever other archetypes they express).
