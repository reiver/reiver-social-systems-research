§ Social-Systems Research

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**Social-Systems Research** is the research of **social-systems**.

Someone who researches **social-systems** might try to model said **social-systems** by describing it by a set of [[social-systems-archetype]]s.

When describing a [[social-systems-archetype]], //"neutral"// language should be used.
It should try be **descriptive**.
I.e., try to list out what is there.
//Not// be a statement of what should or shouldn't be there.
Not be an endorsement or a condemnation of anything that is there.
Be a **description** of what seems to be observed.
